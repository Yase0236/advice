            A Danish person emits 17 tons of CO2 on average per year. 5 tons of it is public emissions, operating hospitals etc. and infrastructure. The remaining 12 tons are possible to reduce by making changes in YOUR behavior. According to the
            Danish thinktank Concito, there are four major areas of consumption a Danish person can be vary of: food, transportation, consumption and activism.
          </p>
          <p>In the food category we can bring down our CO2 emissions by eating far less lamb and beef, eating products that are locally produced and in season and also avoid creating food waste.</p>
          <p>
            When it comes to transport, the bike is obviously the best alternative, but public transportation like trains and buses are more realistic alternatives for traveling. Flying and driving a car are more heavy on the emissions and release
            more CO2.
          </p>
          <p>
            General consumption and shopping are also heavy on CO2 emissions, because producing things and transporting them around the world costs a lot of CO2. Therefore buying less and better - and holding on to it for longer - is a good way to
            bring down your personal CO2 emissions. Buying second hand and mending broken things instead of replacing them with new are also effective ways to use fewer resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last area is getting involved in climate activism. There are different things to do here. You can demonstrate, meet like-minded people in different communities and share knowledge and opinions with eachother and also do this on social
            media. This may sound very simple, but can still be an effective way of making sure everyone else are aware of their CO2 emission aswell.

          <p>
            Streaming tv shows and watching videos online has a heavy price when it comes to emitting CO2. Reducing screen time in general might be the best tip, since watching videos are now 1% of the global CO2 emissions according to the French
            thinktank The Shift Project.
          </p>
          <p>Adjusting your habits could also include turning off autoplay on Youtube and other sites and make sure you don’t let videos play without watching them.</p>
          <p>The higher the resolution the higher the emission, so consider using a smaller resolution for videos that are not your Saturday night Blockbuster. Avoid streaming when you can download for example audio files and music.</p>
          <p>Closing tabs on your browser helps so the video ads don’t play without your knowledge.</p>
