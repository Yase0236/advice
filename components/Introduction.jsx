      <h1>Check how much CO2 you emit while using your phone. </h1>
      <h2>Using phones emits a lot of CO2 by using energy for transferring data, powering giant data centers and loading content. It is our goal to shine a light on the CO2 emissions from our everyday use of cellphones.</h2>

        Did you know that just by using your phone you emit CO2? You do! Or you don’t, but the data centers storing data do and so do the constant traffic of data that travels across the globe through cables, satellites and data centers. Research
        shows that people are not aware of the large CO2 emissions from screen use, and we are here to change that!
